# CAD-Lite-Recommendations
This is a script that will pull unit recommendations from CAD Lite based on the simplified reponse plans identified by agencies during the basic unit recommendations trial.

This script connects to an API to read real time unit data from cadlite.org. Logs are output to a connection log and a recommendation log. 

Upcoming changes will be to move response plans to an XML file and to add support for agency level response plans
